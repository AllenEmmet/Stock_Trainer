<!-- # Stock_Trainer
Stock market app for miming real life trades (NO REAL FINANCES INVOLVED!)
This is a work in progress (I am still adding functionality and playing with the front end styling)--it's main use is to show my skillset 
to potential employers. 
If you want to run the app on your own, you'll need to do a few things: 
 1) All node modules for React have been ignored in this push, so you will need to install them on your own. You also need cookieparser, jwt, express, axios and other libraries/modules.
 2) My token for the finnhub.io API has not been included. If you want to use this application, you'll need to change the URL in the getStockPrice
 method within the user.controller.js file.
 3) I will add a more complete set of instructions once the app is in a more final state, I'm still adding functionality and changing the design.
 In short, start with the above modules and the error messages should let you know which ones are essential but that I haven't yet added above.
